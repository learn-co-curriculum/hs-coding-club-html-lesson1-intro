Welcome to your very first code club unit! By the end of this lesson, you'll be a master of HTML.

##Some Things You Should Know

The very first thing you should do after reading this intro is get familiar with Nitrous. Please read the lesson `Getting Set Up With Nitrous` before you do anything else!

Every week includes three parts: comes equipped with several things:

1. An Intro - Just like today, this will highlight the most important sections to get through, and provide information on things like the hashtags to use to share your work!

2. Tech News- Every week Flatiron will be emailing your club founder some tech news with interesting articles, videos, etc. There's a lot more to learning how to code than the code itself, and we want to share all of that with you!

3. A Lesson - This is where you'll learn all the main concepts. Each lesson will walk you through an activity, and then dive into further explanation of how that activity worked.

4. A Lab - This is where you'll go to practice the skills you picked up during the lesson. Practice makes perfect!

5. Extra Resources - Still want more? This section will point you to great resources online to read and learn more about the concepts covered in the lesson and labs.

6. `How To: Open A Lab` - You will see this section repeated in every single week. This section will remind you how to open a lab in Nitrous, and start working. You can also refer back to this section if you forget how to get started.

In this first week, the lesson is `Hack Twitter With HTML`. This lesson has two main parts: an activity and an explanation. The most important thing is that you get through the activity. The rest is bonus material to help you continue to learn at your own interest level and pace.
