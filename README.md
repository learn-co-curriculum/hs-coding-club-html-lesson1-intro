Welcome to your very first code club unit! By the end of this lesson, you'll be a master at HTML.

##Some Things You Should Know

The very first thing you should do after reading this intro is get familiar with Nitrous. Please read the lesson `Getting Set Up With Nitrous` before you do anything else!

Every unit comes equipped with three things:

1. A Lesson
2. A Lab
3. Extra Resources

In this case, the lesson is `Hack Twitter With HTML`. This lesson has two main parts: an activity and an explanation. The most important thing is that you get through the activity. The rest is bonus material to help you continue to learn at your own interest level and pace.
